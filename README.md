# Unofficial Transcript Generator

## Why?

We need to submit **unofficial** transcript in many cases.  
But our **unofficial** transcript which is free to download does not include sufficient information, and it's layout is very unpleasant to see.  
And our **official** transcript charges CA$ 11.57 to order.  
As a student(broke...), this fee is too expensive when I don't really need the official transcript.  
I just wanted to allow UBC students to save money for this case and buy three Starbucks coffees, or three blue-chip cookies
